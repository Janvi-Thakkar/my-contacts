# my-contacts

Created app using MERN Stack.

This part of app contain frontend part which is in React. Another part contain Mongodb, Express, Node.

I have used Mongodb atlas as database. Express and Nodejs to write api and connection of backend server.

This app helped me to learn CRUD operations in Mongodb.

Features: - User will be able to create account where Mobile number, Name, Email and Password fields are mandatory.
          - User will need to signin using their mobile number and password whenever he/she will need to login again once logged out. 
          - Passwords are stored as hashed key in the database.
          - User will only be able to login once he/she has entered right password. This will enable security and privacy in the app.
          - User will be able to create new contacts with Mobile number, Email and Name fields.
          - User can modify contact detail such as name or email.
          - User will be able to delete contact  .
